## CSV Format

Each row must have at least **5 columns**. A 7-column format is also supported (header row is auto-detected and skipped):

```
drug_a_id, drug_a_name, drug_b_id, drug_b_name, interaction_strength [, mechanism [, category]]
```

| Column | Field | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `drug_a_id` | Unique drug identifier |
| 2 | `drug_a_name` | Display name |
| 3 | `drug_b_id` | Unique drug identifier |
| 4 | `drug_b_name` | Display name |
| 5 | `interaction_strength` | Numeric value (any consistent scale) |
| 6 | `mechanism` | Short text describing the mechanism (e.g. `Absorption`, `Metabolism`, `Synergy`). Use `Unknown` when unknown — this value is treated as absent. |
| 7 | `category` | Ignored (reserved for future use) |

Example:
```
DDInter001,Warfarin,DDInter002,Aspirin,0.85,Synergy,Blood
DDInter001,Warfarin,DDInter003,Ibuprofen,0.72,Unknown,Blood
```

**Parsing rules:**
- Rows with non-numeric strength or fewer than 5 columns are silently skipped.
- Mechanism values that are `Unknown`, blank, or purely numeric (malformed rows) are stored as `NULL`.
- Column 7 (category) is parsed but not stored or used.
- The DB is **fully rebuilt from the CSV on every server start**, so any change to the CSV takes effect on the next restart.

### Drug-food interactions

A CSV with a header row and the following columns:

```
Severity level, Food name, Description, Management, Mechanism, References, drug_id
```

- `Severity level` must be an integer (1–5). Rows where it isn't a valid
  integer (e.g. `"No matching records"`) are skipped.
- `drug_id` should match the drug ID values used in the interactions CSV
  (e.g. `DDInter1075`).
- `References` is read but not currently surfaced by the API.
- The table is rebuilt from this CSV on every server start. If the file is
  missing, food-interaction lookups simply return empty results.

### Drug-disease interactions

A CSV with a header row and the following columns:

```
Severity level, Disease name, Text, drug_id
```

- `Severity level` must be an integer (1–5). Rows where it isn't a valid
  integer (e.g. `"No matching records"`) are skipped.
- `drug_id` should match the drug ID values used in the interactions CSV
  (e.g. `DDInter1075`).
- `Text` describes the risk/contraindication for that disease.
- The table is rebuilt from this CSV on every server start. If the file is
  missing, disease-interaction lookups simply return empty results.

## Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: point to a different CSV or DB location
export DRUG_CSV=/path/to/interactions.csv   # default: interactions.csv
export DRUG_DB=/path/to/interactions.db     # default: interactions.db
export SIM_CUTOFF=0.90                      # similarity threshold (default 0.90)

uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

On startup the server will:
1. Drop and rebuild `interactions.db` from the CSV.
2. Compute and persist pairwise Sørensen-Dice matching scores (skipped if already present).
3. Print the interaction count and be ready at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Risk Model

### Per-drug risk
Each drug's risk score is the **average interaction strength with the other drugs currently in the regime** (not all interactions in the database). Drugs with no recorded interactions with any regime partner contribute `0` and are shown with `avg_strength: null`.

### Regime risk
The **Regime Risk** displayed in the UI is the average of all individual drug risk scores:

```
regime_risk = sum(drug risks) / number_of_drugs
```

### Coverage
Coverage is the percentage of unique drug pairs in the regime that have at least one recorded interaction entry in the database.

### Matching scores (similarity)
Pairwise drug similarity uses the **Sørensen-Dice coefficient** over shared interaction neighbourhoods:

```
Score(A, B) = 2 × |neighbours(A) ∩ neighbours(B)| / (|neighbours(A)| + |neighbours(B)|)
```

Scores are precomputed for all drug pairs at startup and cached in `matching_scores` (persists across restarts). The "Similar Drug Replacements" section lists drugs outside the regime with a matching score ≥ the `SIM_CUTOFF` threshold (default 90%), sorted by total interaction count.

### Food interactions

For every drug in the regime, the API looks up any known drug-food
interactions and returns them sorted by severity (highest first). Each
entry includes the food name, a severity score (1–5), a description of the
interaction, the recommended management/mitigation, and the underlying
mechanism (e.g. absorption, metabolism). Drugs with no known food
interactions return an empty `foods` list.

### Disease interactions

For every drug in the regime, the API also looks up any known
drug-disease (contraindication) warnings and returns them sorted by
severity (highest first). Each entry includes the disease/condition name,
a severity score (1–5), and a text description of the risk. Drugs with no
known disease interactions return an empty `diseases` list.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is a Vite + React project located in `frontend/`. Dependencies are listed in `frontend/package.json`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # production build → frontend/dist/
```

Set `API_BASE` at the top of `src/App.jsx` if your backend runs on a different port.

### UI Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Drug input bar** | Tag-style multi-drug selector with live autocomplete. Click outside or select a drug to close the dropdown. Backspace removes the last tag. |
| **Regime Risk** | Summary cards: overall risk score, DB coverage %, and drug count. |
| **Individual Drug Risk** | Per-drug risk bar (avg interaction strength with regime partners only). |
| **Pairwise Matching Scores** | Sørensen-Dice similarity for each pair within the regime, plus the interaction mechanism where known. |
| **Similar Drug Replacements** | For each regime drug, lists similar alternatives (score ≥ 90%) with their total interaction counts compared to the original drug's count. |

## Cloud Deployment (Vercel + Supabase)

The project is being migrated to Vercel (frontend, hosted straight from GitHub)
+ Supabase (Postgres). This is in progress; today only the data migration and
frontend scaffolding are in place. The FastAPI backend still runs against the
local SQLite DB rebuilt from CSVs, as described above - `main.py` has not yet
been rewritten to query Postgres.

### 1. Create a Supabase project

In the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard), create a new
project and wait for it to finish provisioning. Then go to
**Project Settings -> Database -> Connection string** and copy the
**Transaction pooler** string (port `6543`) - it's the one safe to use from
many short-lived connections (a one-off script today, serverless functions
later), unlike the direct connection on port `5432`.

### 2. Import the data into Supabase

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# edit backend/.env and paste in your DATABASE_URL

pip install -r requirements.txt
cd backend
python migrate_to_supabase.py
```

This applies [`backend/schema.sql`](backend/schema.sql) and loads, from
scratch each run (`TRUNCATE` then reload - safe to re-run after the source
files change):

- `interactions.csv` -> `interactions`
- (computed) Sorensen-Dice similarity -> `matching_scores`
- `drug_food.csv` -> `food_interactions`
- `drug_disease.csv` -> `disease_interactions`
- `cid_to_ddinter.csv` + `Drug_SE_DB/meddra_freq.tsv/meddra_freq.tsv` -> `side_effects`

None of these source files are committed to git (see `.gitignore`), so this
script only needs to be run from a machine that has them locally - it is not
part of the Vercel build.

### 3. Deploy the frontend to Vercel

[`vercel.json`](vercel.json) builds `frontend/` with Vite and serves
`frontend/dist`. Import the GitHub repo in Vercel as-is (repo root, not
`frontend/`) and it will pick this up automatically. Set the `VITE_API_BASE`
env var in the Vercel project to point at wherever the backend is reachable
(see `frontend/.env.example`) - until the backend is converted to run on
Vercel too, this still means a separately-hosted FastAPI instance.

## Performance Notes

- SQLite with indexes on both drug ID columns handles 200 k+ rows in milliseconds for typical queries.
- The matching-score precomputation is the slow step (O(n²) over all drugs) — it runs once at first startup and is skipped on subsequent restarts unless the DB is rebuilt.
- For very large CSVs the build step batches inserts in chunks of 10,000 rows.
- If you outgrow SQLite, swapping to PostgreSQL requires only changing the connection string and driver.
